This is a learning/play project with two goals: 

1. To learn Rust
2. To follow along with [Eric Lippert's series about Conway's Game of Life](https://ericlippert.com/2020/04/13/life-part-1/)

Given that I'm learning both at the same time, along with a few other things (such as VSCode) I expect this to be a mess, at least to start. Please don't judge me too harshly.
