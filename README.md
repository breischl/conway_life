This is a learning/play project with two goals: 

1. To learn Rust
2. To follow along with [Eric Lippert's series about Conway's Game of Life](https://ericlippert.com/2020/04/13/life-part-1/)

I'm learning both the language and the domain at the same time, so judge the code quality and organization accordingly. 

In the end this contains several different approaches to implementing the underlying game board (a statically-sized board, and an infinitely-expanding board). There is also a Terminal UI view.
